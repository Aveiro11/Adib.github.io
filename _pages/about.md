👨🏻‍🎓 I'm currently pursuing Master's Degree in Language Technology at the University of Gothenburg. I'm a B.Sc graduate in Computer Science & Engineering from International Islamic University Chittagong.

🔬 My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Big Data Analysis and Language Modalities and Semi-Supervised Learning!

💼 I've previously worked as a Business Analyst, Data Analyst and hold  almost a year worth of experience as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant.

🏅 Apart from my academic prowess, I also represented my university in many national and international debate tournaments.

# Selected Experience
## 📊 Business Analyst
As a **Business Analyst** at [NEXT Ventures](https://nextventures.io/), I analyze trading and market data to drive strategic decisions, conduct R&D on market and fintech trends, and collaborate cross-functionally with product, engineering, compliance, and marketing teams. I also stay continuously updated on industry developments to help the organization adapt and maintain its competitive edge. NEXT Ventures is a global fintech group operating trading platforms like FundedNext and FNMarkets, serving over 220,000 traders in more than 170 countries with a team of 450+ professionals.

## 👩‍💻 Data Analyst
I have worked as a **Data Analyst Intern** at [Hydroquo+ Labs](https://bd.linkedin.com/company/hydroquo), located in Banani, Dhaka. During my tenure, I contributed to two government-funded projects. The first was a joint research program with the Water Resources Planning Organisation of Bangladesh (WARPO) on the Surma River Water Level Prediction System. The second was a joint maintenance program of the Saidabad Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) Project with the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA), which was essential for the residents as SWTP was responsible for providing drinkable water to the entire area.

## 📜 Teaching Assistantship
My prowess in programming, familiarity with frameworks like react and django, sincere enthusiasm for research, and a robust academic background led to my selection as a Teaching Assistant back at 2022. Under the mentorship of the then Chairman of the Department of CSE [Professor Dr. Engr. Abdul Kadar Muhammad Masum](https://faculty.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/profile/swe/kadar.html) during my final undergraduate year, I actively contributed to class sessions, supervised labs, and played a pivotal role in upholding academic integrity. This experience not only honed my teaching abilities but also deepened my commitment to academic excellence and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
Under the mentorship of my former supervisor, [Dr. Muhammed Jamshed Alam Patwary](https://cuet.ac.bd/members/770), I was engaged in many research projects. In addition to being the author of two research papers, I was also involved with several research groups supervised by Dr. Patwary, where I guided them in data extraction and model development.

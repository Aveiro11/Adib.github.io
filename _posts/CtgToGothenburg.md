When I decided to further my NLP research, Sweden quickly stood out. After publishing papers and gaining experience as a data analyst and teaching assistant, I turned my attention to top European universities. Swedish institutions like KTH, Chalmers, Lund, and the University of Gothenburg all have established language technology programs and that’s where my journey began.

**1. Why Sweden?**

Sweden offers a unique combination of practical research opportunities and a collaborative academic environment. Labs are often well-funded, and many projects welcome student involvement. For someone passionate about language technology, the chance to work with leading researchers and access modern resources made Sweden a natural choice.

**2. Navigating UniversityAdmissions.se**

The Swedish application portal, UniversityAdmissions.se, simplifies the process by allowing up to four program selections per application (900 SEK each). You submit your documents, rank your preferences, and wait for decisions. I found it helpful to create a table listing each program’s entry requirements, tuition fees, and scholarship options before logging in to apply.

**3. Choosing the Right Programs**

I spent time downloading syllabi and comparing course modules, research topics, and thesis requirements. In the end, I ranked the specialized NLP track at the University of Gothenburg highest, since its focus matched my research interests. As backups, I picked strong AI and data science programs at other universities, where each choice balanced my ambition with a realistic path forward.

**4. Preparing and Sending Documents**

Gathering my paperwork was a juggling act alongside my full-time role as a business analyst. I arranged for:

An attested bachelor’s transcript signed by my university

A sealed registrar’s envelope

My IELTS certificate (7.5 overall)

As a bangladeshi student my university had to send my attested transcripts in a sealed envelope in the below mentioned address (For DHL):

**5. Admission and Scholarship News**

March 2025: The day after Eid, I received an email confirming my conditional admission to the Language Technology program at the University of Gothenburg. The timing was perfect, which was just before returning to work, I could share the news with family and friends.
April 2025: While traveling back to Dhaka to resume work, I checked my inbox again and saw that I had been awarded the Axel Adler Scholarship, covering both tuition and insurance. That moment made all the effort worthwhile.

**6. Applying for the Residence Permit**

With acceptance and scholarship confirmed, I moved on to the residence permit:

Late April 2025: Submitted the online application on the Swedish Migration Agency website.

Early May 2025: Booked a biometrics appointment at the Swedish Embassy in Dhaka.

May 13, 2025: Completed my fingerprint scan and a brief interview at the embassy, where I discussed my study plan.

The clear guidance and digital forms made the process straightforward.

**8. Reflections and Advice**

Looking back, detailed planning and consistent follow‑through made the difference. If you’re considering Sweden:

Start early: Give yourself time to gather transcripts and prepare proofs of English.

Stay organized: A simple spreadsheet for deadlines, document statuses, and appointments is invaluable.

Connect online: Join student groups in social media and hover through YouTube to learn about housing, part-time work, and campus life.

Learn a few words: Basic Swedish phrases ease everyday tasks and help you feel at home.

Moving from Chittagong to Göteborg was a straightforward yet rewarding process. Now I'm looking for future journy at Sweden.
